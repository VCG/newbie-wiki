    "## Background\n",
    "We will consider two extensions to the real numbers:  complex numbers and dual numbers.  A complex number is defined as $$z = a + ib$$ where $i^{2} = -1$.  $a$ is the real part and $b$ is the imaginary part.  The polar form of a complex number is $$z = \\left|z\\right|e^{i\\theta}$$ where $\\left|z\\right|^{2} = zz^{*} = a^{2} + b^{2}$ and $z^{*} = a - ib$ is the complex conjugate of $z$.  The angle between $a$ and $b$ is given by $$\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The dual numbers look similar.  We have $d = a + \\epsilon b$ where $\\epsilon$ is a number (not zero!) such that $\\epsilon^{2} = 0$.  Once again $a$ is the real part, but here $b$ is the dual part.  The polar form of this number is \n",
    "$$d = \\displaystyle a\\left(1 + \\epsilon \\frac{b}{a}\\right).$$  Note that the magnitude of the dual number $\\left|d\\right| = a$ since $dd^{*} = \\left(a + \\epsilon b\\right)\\left(a - \\epsilon b\\right) = a$ where $d^{*} = a - \\epsilon b$ is the conjugate of $d$.\n",

    "Dual numbers are a route to automatic differentiation.  We'll mention them again next week in the AD lectures.\n",

    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1\n",
    "For today, your task is to write a module called `mynumbers.py`.  The module should contain, at a minimum the following:\n",
    "* A base class called `RealExtensions` with a constructor that accepts $a$ and $b$.\n",
    "* A subclass called `Complex` (inherits from `RealExtensions`) that has the following methods:\n",
    "  * Compute the magnitude of the complex number\n",
    "    * **Note:** This method should be preceeded by a single underscore to indicate that it should not be accessed by a user.\n",
    "  * Compute the \"angle\" of the complex number\n",
    "    * **Note:** This method should be preceeded by a single underscore to indicate that it should not be accessed by a user.\n",
    "  * Compute the polar form of the complex number using `_magnitude()` and `_angle()`\n",
    "* A subclass called `Dual` (inherits from `RealExtensions`) that has methods for compute the magnitude and \"angle\" of the dual number.\n",
    "  * Compute the magnitude of the dual number\n",
    "    * **Note:** This method should be preceeded by a single underscore to indicate that it should not be accessed by a user.\n",
    "  * Compute the \"angle\" of the dual number\n",
    "    * **Note:** This method should be preceeded by a single underscore to indicate that it should not be accessed by a user.\n",
    "  * Compute the polar form of the dual number using `_magnitude()` and `_angle()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of \"hiding\" the `magnitude()` and `angle()` methods may not be a good one.  The goal is to show that this is not really privacy; it's more of a contract between people using the code.  Note that a user can still access `_magnitude()` and `_angle()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Import your module using `import mynumbers` and play around with creating complex and dual numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2\n",
    "Once you're happy with your module, make the following change:\n",
    "* Rename the `Complex` subclass as `_Complex`\n",
    "* Now import your module using `from mynumbers import *`\n",
    "* Try to create a complex number.  What happens?\n",
    "  * **Note:** You can use `dir()` to see what's in your namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 3\n",
    "This part is open-ended.  Can you think of a situation in which you may want to use name-mangling for this problem?  Think about a case where a subclass might redefine a method or name from the superclass, but the superclass should still have access to the name."

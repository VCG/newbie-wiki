    "# Exercise 1\n",
    "Last lecture, you wrote a class to create circles from two points:  the circle center and another point on the circle.  Of course, someone might want to create a circle simply by providing the radius and no coordinate information.  They should still be able to do all the same calculations as before (area and circumference.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will provide this functionality by writing a subclass called `Rcircle` of the superclass `Circle`.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Requirements\n",
    "* Must inherit from `Circle`\n",
    "* Must have it's own constructor.  The constructor accepts the circle radius supplied by the user as its argument.  That is `__init__(self, r)`.\n",
    "* The circle radius must be set in the constructor\n",
    "* The `Rcircle` subclass must reimplement the `radius` function.  It does not make sense for `Rcircle` to inherit the `radius` method from `Circle` since an instance of `Rcircle` doesn't know anything about the coordinates of the circle.\n",
    "* Include the `__eq__` special method to compare two circles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Demo your class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bonus\n",
    "Feel free to play with some of the other *dunder* methods.  For example, it might be fun to add two circles (you get to define what that means!).  Be careful with `__add__`; you'll need to look into using `__radd__` as well.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What other dunder methods would make sense?"
